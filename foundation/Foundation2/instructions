Foundation #2: Encapsulation with Online Ordering

-product ordering system
-sell many products online to a variety of customers
-need to produce:
    ***packing labels***
    ***shipping labels***
    ***compute final prices for billing***

***Program Specification***
Write a program that has classes:
    Product
    Customer
    Address
    Order

***Order***
    -list of products
    -a customer
    ***Responsibilities***
    -calculate the total cost of the order
    -return a string for the packing label
    -return a string for the shipping label

***The final price is calculated as
    the sum of the total cost of each product plus a one-time shipping cost
    ***total order price + shipping fee***

This company is based in the USA.
    If the customer ***lives in the USA shipping cost is $5***
    If the customer does ***not live in the USA shipping cost is $35***

***A packing label should***
    list the ***name and product id of each product*** in the order

***A shipping label should***
    list the ***name and address of the customer***

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***Product***
    name
    product id
    price
    quantity of each product

The total cost of this product is computed by : 
    ***price per unit * quantity*** 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***Customer***
    name
    address

The name is a string, but the ***Address is a class***
The customer should:
    -a method that can return whether they live in the USA or not. 
    ***(Hint this should call a method on the address to find this.)***

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***Address***
    contains a string for:
        street address
        the city
        state/province
        country
            ***The address should have a method that can return whether it is in the USA or not***
            ***The address should have a method to return a string all of its fields together in one string (with newline characters where appropriate)***

***Other considerations***
Make sure that ***all member variables are private*** and getters, setters, and constructors are created as needed.

Once you have created these classes
Write a program that
    -creates at least two orders with a 2-3 products each
    -Call the methods to get the:
        packing label
        the shipping label
        total price of the order
        display the results of these methods.

User Interaction
***you do not need to create a menu system or a user interface***

Showing Creativity
***you are not expected to show creativity and exceed the core requirements the way you have in previous projects***

***My expected Output***
