***Activity Instructions***
Practice the principle of inheritance by creating a base class and derived classes.

For this activity, you will write classes to:
    -represent different kinds of homework assignments.
    
Consider the following example of Math and writing assignments.

***Math Assignments***
A Math assignment may need to:
    -store the student's name, 
    -the topic (for example, "Fractions"), 
    -the textbook section (for example, "7.3"), 
    -the problems from that section (for example, "3-10, 20-21").
    ***should have a constructor that requires a value for each of the items that it stores***.
    ***needs to provide a method to return a summary of the assignment that contains the student's name and the topic***
    ***needs to provide a method to display the Math homework list including the section number and the problems (for example, "Section 7.3 Problems 8-19")***

***Writing Assignments***
A writing assignment may need to:
    -store the student's name, the topic (for example, "European History"), and the title of the assignment (for example, "The Causes of World War II").

The writing assignment should have:
    -a constructor that requires a value for each of the items that it stores.
    -needs to provide a method to return a summary of the assignment that contains the student's name and the topic
    -provide a method to get the writing information which consists of the title and the student's name (for example, "The Causes of World War II by Mary Waters").

***Class Diagram Without Inheritance***
From these diagrams you can see that the _studentName and _topic attributes are the same in both classes, and so is the GetSummary() method. Instead of duplicating these items, you can create a base class that they both inherit from.

The following class diagram shows an approach that uses inheritance. This is the approach you will use for this assignment.

1. Begin by creating a new file and a class for your base Assignment class.
2. Add the attributes as private member variables.
3. Create a ***constructor for this class that receives a student name and topic and sets the member variables***.
4. Add the method for ***GetSummary()*** to return the student's name and the topic.
5. Test your class by returning to the Main method in the Program.cs file. Create a simple assignment, call the method to get the summary, and then display it to the screen.
***Sample Output: Samuel Bennett - Multiplication*** //name and topic

***Create the MathAssignment class***
    Create a new file for the MathAssignment class.
    Create this class and make sure to ***specify that it inherits from the base Assignment class***.
    Add the attributes as ***private member variables***. Make sure that you ***do not create new member variables for the ones you inherited from the base class***.
    Create a constructor for your class that accepts all four parameters, have it ***call the base class constructor*** to set the base class attributes that way.
    Add the ***GetHomeworkList() method***.
    Test your class by returning to the Main method and creating a new MathAssignment object and set its values. Make sure to test both the GetSummary() and the GetHomeworkList() methods.
    ***Sample Output: Roberto Rodriguez - Fractions | Section 7.3 Problems 8-19***

***Create the WritingAssignment class***
    Follow the same pattern as before by creating a new file for the WritingAssignment class.
    Create the class and set up the inheritance relationship.
    Add the member variables and set up the constructor as you did for the MathAssignment class.
    Add the ***GetWritingInformation()*** method.
    Notice that this method needs to access the _studentName variable defined in the base class. Even though WritingAssignment class inherited this attribute, it is private, so you cannot access it directly in the derived class.

To get the data you need for the method you can either make the variable protected in the base class, or you can create a public GetStudentName method to return it.

***Mary Waters - European History | The Causes of World War II by Mary Waters***
